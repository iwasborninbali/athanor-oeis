# Task: status and proof attempt for the conjecture in OEIS A072567

Answer in English. This file is self-contained.

## Why
Item 17 of our list of conjecture candidates in OEIS sequences with the keyword `hard`
(https://github.com/iwasborninbali/athanor-oeis/blob/main/research/2026-11-hard-ranking/README.md#b-conjecture-candidates).
The list comes from an automatic screen and can be wrong (one item was already proved in its own entry; another had
been proved in a preprint three days earlier). Our aim is to turn true conjectures into theorems, or refute them, with
every step checkable.

## The object
OEIS A072567: A variant of Zarankiewicz problem: maximal number of 1s in n X n 01-matrix with no four 1s forming a rectangle.

Terms: 1,3,6,9,12,16,21,24,29,34,39,45,52,56,61,67,74,81,88,96,105,108,115,

Conjecture stated in the entry:
> Conjecture: the same number of 1s is achieved for symmetric n X n matrices (cf. A350189). - _Max Alekseyev_, Apr 03 2022

## What to do
1. **Status.** Is the statement open, proved, refuted, equivalent to a known open problem, or ill-posed? Search the
   entry, its links and related entries, the OEIS wiki, arXiv, Zenodo, MathSciNet/zbMATH-indexed literature and the
   web, **including preprints from the last four weeks** (search Zenodo and arXiv by keywords and by A-number). Cite
   exactly (author, year, place) and quote the decisive sentence. If it is known, stop after step 4 with the citation.
2. **Proof or counterexample.** If open: prove it, refute it, reduce it to a named open problem, or prove the strongest
   partial result you can. Make the statement precise first. Every step must be checkable. Lean 4 / Mathlib welcome.
3. **Check.** Write a short program that tests the statement (and any lemma you rely on) as far as is cheap, run it,
   and report the exact output and range.
4. **Verdict.** One paragraph: status, what is new (if anything) and how sure you are; what an OEIS comment would say.
   Be strict: never present known material as new; if you did not search a source, say so.

## Rules
- Keep each claim's status explicit: proved, computed (with range), conjectured, or known (with citation).
- No submissions or edits to the OEIS: this task only produces a report.

## What to return
One Markdown answer with sections 1–4. The lab's guide reviews it independently (re-implementing every computation)
and commits it under [answers/](answers/).
